# Anti-Pegasus: AI-Driven Spyware Detection and Prevention  

## Overview  
The invasive nature of tools like Pegasus is a stark reminder of the threats to privacy and freedom in the digital age. This project aims to develop an open-source, AI-driven solution to detect, prevent, and neutralize sophisticated spyware like Pegasus. By leveraging cutting-edge machine learning and real-time monitoring, we hope to empower individuals and organizations to protect their devices and data from unauthorized surveillance.  

This project is open-source because we believe in transparency, collaboration, and the power of community to tackle global challenges. Together, we can build a tool that makes a real difference.

## Key Features  
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously monitor system calls, network traffic, and file changes for suspicious activity.  
- **AI-Driven Anomaly Detection**: Use machine learning models to identify and flag spyware behavior.  
- **Zero-Click Exploit Mitigation**: Detect and block attempts to exploit vulnerabilities without user interaction.  
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Compatible with mobile (Android/iOS) and desktop (Windows/macOS) systems.  
- **User-Friendly Alerts**: Provide clear, actionable notifications when threats are detected.
